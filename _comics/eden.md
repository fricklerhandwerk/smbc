Adam and Eve! Are you eating from the tree of knowledge?!

Uhâ€¦

Hoo boy.

Well, at least humanity got knowledge before we left.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Say, did you eat from any other forbidden plants?

A few, you?

Just a few.

Shrub of Jealousy

Vine of Avarice

Corn of just kind of being a douche for no reason

Wish I hadn't eaten all those Pinecones of Bastardry.
