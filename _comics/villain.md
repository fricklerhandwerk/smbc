Mom, what's the weirdest thing about being an adult?

You start siding with all the villains.

Most kids' stories are written by people in their 20s and 30s, and they target children. Most villains are middle-aged. This creates misunderstanding.

Consider the Durslays from Harry Potter. Are they perfect? No. But they took in an orphan boy after his parents got killed doing stuff the Dursleys told them was dangerous.

They raised him for eleven years!

Look at Scrooge. Why is Scrooge bad? Because his layabout nephew demands money for an unvetted charity? Think about how many mortgage's Scrooge's bank deposits have paid for?

Emperor Palpatine! He assumes control over an anarchic "republic" of in-fighting factions and immediately builds up state capacity, which would have eventually resulted in a modern-style parliament if he weren't thwarted by monarchs, religious terrorists and people who insist their bloodlines entitle them to rule!

People think kids are kinder than adults, but kids would happily round up and execute anyone Pikachu said was bad.

Because they're bad!

PIKA kill them CHU!
