Wanna get a burger?

What, so hungry people can watch and be jealous?

What're you doing?

I'm trying out a new thing where whenever someone expresses a thought, I reply by assuming the least charitable interpretation.

This gives me a feeling of moral superiourity while leaving my targets too stunned to engage cogently.

Pleaseâ€¦ please don't bring internet into real life.

Oh so your life is more **real** than other people's? *Wow*.

(I'm secretly hoping to get an email with the least charitable interpretation of this comic)
