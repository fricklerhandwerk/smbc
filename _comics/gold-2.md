Hey Leprechaun, why the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow?

Ah, me laddy, 'tis tae maintain artificial scarcity.

If I spread me pot o' gold hither an' thither, 'twould put a wee coin in every pot!

Neyt thing ye know, the gold standard backin' up ye currency ain't worth a tinker's dam, to be sure, to be sure.

The world's been off the gold standard since the late 20th century.

Aye?!

We're fare richer than back then too, but we maintain scarcity by way of cryptocurrency and by making things inefficiently and calling them artisanal.

Sure 'tis no wonder nobody wants me gold.

Do you have a pot of index funds by any chance?

Aye 'tis terrible hard bein' a stereotype, tee toi tee toi.
