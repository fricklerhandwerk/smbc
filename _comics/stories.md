Zorbix, why haven't you revealed yourselves to humanity yet?

**Because you're so delicate!**

Huh?

It is **so** easy to make you guys cry we're scared we'll drown you in tears by accident.

We are not!

Watch this. I'll tell you a completely abstract story:

There was a person who loved another person. But conditions compelled one of the people to cross a large body of water. Later, without realizing it, when it was night, they would look across their respective ends of the large body of water and think of each other.

Two men fight on either side of a war. All of their friends die and they are very angry for many years. Later they are very old, and they meet, and they spontaneously hug each other and cry.

Once there was an old human who was sick. The sick human had an estranged child. After the sick human had suffered brain damage and had no consciousness, the estranged child took care of the sick human's body until it died.

**WAAA**

We must leave until they find a way to be less weird!

Thank god he didn't do one about a puppy and kitty who are best friends.
