God, is life better free or constrained?

Both.

Like, we must be freely true to ourselves yet know the bonds of community life?

Nah.

The ideal human life is one where you live in a tiny confined domain, believing it's the whole universe, then doing really well in those tiny bounds.

Like if you want to be real happy, kill all humans but about 20 and then make sure you're the biggest one.

No outside surprises. Every day is predictable, with small achievable goals. And literally everyone either loves or fears you.

Why did you make us this way?

Satan thinks you all have souls and it's keeping him really distracted.

Honestly couldn't believe he fell for that.
