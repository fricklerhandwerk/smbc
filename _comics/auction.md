Dad, how do I know when I've foundâ€¦ the one?

Are you familiar with the concept of a Dutch auction?

You set a price for an item. Then, you lower the price down and down until you find a bidder above your reserve-price.

If you get no bidders, you overvalued the item. So, you restart the auction at a lower reserve-price. Repeat until a taker comes. Voila, you've found the best that you could get.

Mom said lasting love isn't found, it's created together.

Yes, the equilibrium strategy is to destroy your partner's market value.

If we model stability as happiness, having both partners be afraid to leave is equivalent to love.
