Dad, does it bother you how fast social norms are changing?

Nah.

They were changing fast the entire time you were growing up. A lot of stuff you see as settled and boring was once a big fight with an uncertain outcome.

Youe just didn't perceive it that way because you were focused on cartoons and comic books, and you wouldn't have cared about the public argument even if you could've understood it.

Now that you're older, you imagine the peace you felt during that time is indicative of how the broader culture actually was, which inevitably leads you to feel things are especially chaotic and bad now.

Ah.

Okay, but what about the new Star Wars movies?

They are different and they are worse.

Also, superhero movies were better when they sucked!
