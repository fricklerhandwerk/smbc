Dad, I want to ask this girl out bu twhat if she doesn't like me?

Then run.

**RUN!**

My god that'd be embarrassing. A person who doesn't like **you** in particular. Not just your music taste or hair or whatever, your whole being is rejected outright

This sort of thing is why mom left you, isn't it?

Can't leave me if I don't answer my phone.

2 trillion unread voicemail (approximate)
