Mom, why do i ***have*** to go to school?

Because when you're at school, that's when mommy and daddy screw.

You could stay here if you like, but you might want to cover your ears because in about 7 minutes in there's so much moaning and rattling of chains it sounds like the Jacob Marley scene from *Christmas Carol*.

You've simultaneously ruined home and christmas.

Which is why you should go to school!

Run.
