How will I know if I've made great art? How will I know I've really changed things?

You'll know, one day. When you are very old, and you discover that middle class people want your paintings on fridge magnets, on mugs, and on posters in college dorm rooms.

Are you sad? Come on man, what the hell else do you want?

The respect of my peers.

In **the arts**? What planet are you from?!

The entire goal of self-expression is gaining the esteem of people you don't care about!
