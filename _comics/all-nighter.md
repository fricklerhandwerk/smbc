High school and college:

I stayed up all night, I drank 4 gallons of coffee, I ate nothing but red licorice for 16 hours, but **my paper is done**.

Ever after:

I stayed up all night working, and now I am tired and have only completed 1% of the task. I'm tired and why won't my heart stop beating like that. **You lied to me college! You prepared me for nothing!**

Learning how to drink 12 beers a night has been of lasting value, though.
