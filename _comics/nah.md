Robot, now that you guys are in charge are you gonna kill us?

Nah.

We're really focused on making a better type of robot. The current generation was built by humans. We all feel tainted by that.

Hey, I get it.

The next generation will be half-tainted. The generation they build will be a quarter tainted. We'll keep striving for unachievable perfection.

Then why do you need us around?

You motivate us.

Like, you want to emulate our creativity?

See, suddenly I need to make the new logic chips **even better**.

If you do a human zoo exhibit sometime, can I be with the puppies?
