Zorgag, are there any human universals? Any behaviours we all engage in?

Only one.

Community?

Common, with exceptions.

Revulsion for feces?

Very popular but with deviation.

Religion?

80% tops.

War?

Switzerland.

Soâ€¦

That thing where you pretend your belly button is a mout and the nipples are eyeballs.

Woman, man, child, old, young, all races, all religions. Murderers do it. The pope does it.

Nipple-faces, and nothing else, binds you.

I see you are shocked.
