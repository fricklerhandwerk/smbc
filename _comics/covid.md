Dad! Turn on the news! The missiles are inbound! We have four minutes to nuclear armageddon!

Ah, man. I hope they can make TV still. Do we have boardgames? Things are about to get reallllllll boring.

Living through covid-19 left us unprepared for any other type of calamity.

Boy, I hope there's enough toilet paper to last the whole four minutes.
