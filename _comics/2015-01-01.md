Dear Zeus, please help my daddy stop being sad. I tried praying to other deities, but nothing happened.

Yeah, hey kid. I have basically two powers: lightning and turning into plants and animals for erotic purposes.

Would either of those help?

Wait a sec.

Daddy do you like swans?

Sure?

I'll be right back.

Heard you were lookin' for a good time.

Honk.
