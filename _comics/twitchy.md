**AAAAH! Stop that!**

Stop what?

**You're still doing it!**

That gross thing where humans indicate internal states by squooshing facial muscles in different configurations.

**Stop it! Just keep your face still and tell me how you feel without doing the twitchy muscle blob thing!**

**Oh Jesus the twitchy parts are moist now!**

Your crying also smells bad.
