title: Perfect Life
---

Wise master, should I pursue the perfect life or the perfect work?

The perfect life. A life of peace, joy, compassion.

If you pursue the perfect work, you will always know jealousy. You will look at all beautiful creations, by yourself and others, as mere entries on a giant scoreboard in a game no one ever wins.

You can do that with life too now!

What?

Look, I'll set you up on instagram.

See, the wise master two mountains over has 16 acts of righteousness and compassion today.

Look how many emojis people are responding with. I could never have that.

I am nothing. But not in the meditative sense. In the way that makes me eat cookie butter with a spoon while conflating my desires and hopes with social expectations.

I wouldn't post that. People prefer nudes?
