I don't want Davey to become an engineer like me.

Why?

Too much drudgery. Too much working on other people's dreams. Wish I'd been a poet.

I understand, but how can you stop him if it's his calling?

I have my ways.

What's the matter boy? Remember: refty latchy, righty removey.

And do you know about PEMDAS?
