title: Work Hard
---

Dad, is getting ahead about hard work or about luck and advantages?

Hard work.

If you really focus and dedicate yourself, and really **care** about your future, you can personally sabotage every single one of your peers.

My strategy is to work non-stop and barely sleep, but then act as if life is easy whenever I go to the office. This discourages co-workers or drives them to mental health crises, while simultaneously impressing my bosses.

If I can keep it up for five more years, I'll be in a position to delegate all my work to people just like me. I will enjoy several decades of rising pay for minimal work until I die at my desk and they pick over my corpse like starved animals.

Pick away, you jackals! You can't hurt a man whose soul's already in hell! Hahahahaha!

**AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH**

I'm gonna drop out of the system.

That's **so** selfish.

Sounds like someone need to take you down a peg.
