Dear god, what's the solution to the Fermi Paradox?

You're in hell.

What?

Human civilization. It killed itself in a nuclear war and so now it's in hell.

You guys were first past the gate, literally, so you're alone in hell. You just haven't figured it out yet.

Huh.

Honestly it doesn't seem so bad.

I keep making it worse and you things keep adjusting!

I'm gonna make the Flat Earth people be right! You see if I don't!
