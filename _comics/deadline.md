Hey brain, why are you making me stress about this deadline?

I know I'm gonna get it done on time. You know I'm gonna get it done on time. Stressing in the interim just shortens our shared lifespan and makes us unhappy.

I don't trust you. If I ease up the pressure for an instant you will grow weak.

Could you at least let me sleep tonight?

No.

We're gonna hang out and think about how we have failed.

First of all, you have failed to sleep tonight.
