Approaches to childrearing by engineering discipline:

Chemical Engineering:

By situating the child in an edible non-newtonian fluid, we can constrict its motion while feeding it! Waste products naturally go downward, keeping the child clean. Why am I the only person trying this?!

Mechanical Engineering:

By duct taping the babies together, we can treat them as marginally less than 2 babies. Beyond 10 babies, each additional baby requires no additional effort.

Electrical Engineering:

By magnetically harnessing all baby-motion, we can pay for literally several rounding errors on our electric bill!

Aerospace Engineering:

I added canards to the front of the baby to give it improved stall safety characteristics!

Industrial Engineering:

I believing I have found a way to increase my baby output, but it may be controversial among household workers.

Civil Engineering:

Look, the sanitation system is from eons ago. It's time to do a clean sheet design on these things.

First addition: cup holder.
