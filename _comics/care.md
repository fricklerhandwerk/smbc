Mom, how come adults don't take teenagers' problems seriously?

Because adults can't tell the difference between change in viewpoint and growth wisdom.

I was once like you. Now I am not. I conclude that I improved my understanding, and it follows that my current problems are real and substantial, while yours are silly and ephemeral.

Sou you **do** care that my favorite band broke up?

I have tried. I have tried so hard, but no.

I only like generic pop music from **my** youth!
