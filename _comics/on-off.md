I hate the humans. They **sound** like they're conscious, thoughtful, possessors of free will, but you can manipulate their brains with the most trivial actions.

Watch.

Human! Here's a collage of photos from your life experiences!

Ah. Cool.

Behold! This is the same photoset, displayed one photo at a time, with the photos in motion and fadeouts between, plus violins!

The days… the years… so long yet so fast.

It's like an on/off switch!

I can get 14% more tears by having the images come toward her instead of moving side to side!
