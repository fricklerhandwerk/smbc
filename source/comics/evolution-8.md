title: Evolution

Dear evolution, why did you make it so we believe in free will?

Same reason I made you believe you could communicate with disembodied concepts.

Once you evolve to a certain level of consciousness, brains get freaked at the idea that they're just a piece of meat, decaying, embedded in a biological system.

In order to keep making the brain bigger without compromising sanity, I gotta introduce all sorts of weird delusions. Afterlife, free will, love, and an undefined concept called "meaningfulness." All byproducts of the process. Evolutionary slag.

Emotions like sorrow are just calculation heuristics.

**Stop it!**

You're the one yelling alone in your room.
