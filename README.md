# Transcribe SMBC

This is an effort to transcribe [Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal comics](https://www.smbc-comics.com) to make them searchable.

Using the strips for this purpose with Zach's permission:

## Why?

You're about to make a point in an argument, and that one SMBC strip you read five years ago totally nailed it? But you can't find it anywhere... Fear not!

From now on you can finally search for SMBC content on the web. With luck, the comic in question is already transcribed by volunteers and indexed by search engines.

Worst case, you can search [right here on GitHub](https://github.com/fricklerhandwerk/smbc).

## Contributing
